# üéì Crack-GRE-Vocab

This project is my final submission for **DIG-245 Critical Web Design** at Davidson College. The central focus of this project is to enhance the efficiency and engagement of GRE vocabulary learning through a web application.

## üìö Project Overview

This web app designed an adaptive learning platform that uses **spaced repetition** and **active recall** techniques to maximize long-term vocabulary retention. The app offers accurate word definitions and pronunciation, allowing users to learn efficiently. Additionally, it provides a dashboard for users to view their learning progress.

### üåü Key Features

- **Adaptive Learning:** Utilizes spaced repetition to optimize memory retention.
- **Active Recall:** Encourages active recall practice for more effective learning.
- **Accurate Word Definitions & Pronunciation:** Helps users learn precise meanings and proper pronunciation.
- **Progress Dashboard:** Users can track their progress and stay motivated.
- **Free**

This app is perfect for college students struggling with the limited free resources available for GRE verbal preparation and aiming to improve their scores.

## üöÄ Try It Out!

The web app is live! You can try it out at [www.crackgrevocab.co](http://www.crackgrevocab.co).  
- The **frontend** is hosted on Vercel.
- The **backend** is hosted on PythonAnywhere.
